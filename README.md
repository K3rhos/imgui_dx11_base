# ImGUI DirectX 11 Base

This is a clean Universal ImGui DirectX11 base project I made for my personal usages, using C++ 20.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is a base made for learning and testing purposes, this is not a ready to use dll, there is no features relative to a specific game.

# How to use

- Compile the dll using <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/community/">Visual Studio 2022</a>
- Use a dll injector to inject the previously compiled one into the game.

> [!TIP]
> I personally recommend using <a href="https://systeminformer.sourceforge.io/">System Informer</a> to inject your dll during testing or you can also build/use your own injector.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure to use this dll into singleplayer games only, I'm not responsible of any game bans this could lead to.
